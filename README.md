# 🏦 Banking Data Warehouse (SQL Project)

This repository contains a project that demonstrates the development of a **Banking Data Warehouse** using SQL.  
The main objective is to transform raw operational banking data into a structured warehouse model that supports reporting and decision-making.

## 📊 Overview
The project showcases how a data warehouse can be designed for the banking sector, starting from raw transaction data, applying **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes**, and storing it into a well-structured schema.  
With this approach, the system enables better understanding of banking activities, customer behaviors, and organizational performance.

## 🗂️ Data Modeling
- Designed using a **star schema** consisting of fact and dimension tables.  
- Covers essential banking entities such as customers, employees, accounts, transactions, and branches.  
- Allows flexible analysis across different perspectives (time, location, transaction type, etc.).  

## 🔄 ETL Process
The project illustrates the ETL process:  
1. **Extract** – Collecting raw operational banking data.  
2. **Transform** – Cleaning and standardizing the data.  
3. **Load** – Storing it into the warehouse schema for analysis.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- SQL (DDL, DML)  
- Data Warehouse design & modeling  
- ETL implementation
